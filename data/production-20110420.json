Some thoughts:\r\n\r\n1) Clarify the purpose of this language. It is too simple as a bill/resolution in Congress, but too complicated as rallying language.\r\n\r\n2) The House and Senate have significantly different rules.  One needs to amend the chambers' respective standing rules precisely (as did the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970).\r\n\r\n3) Precise language amending the standing rules of the House to require 72 hours has been introduced in the 110th Congress by Rep. Brian Baird (D-WA) as H.Res. 504, which has attracted bipartisan cosponsors.  Many of the issues noted by others above are resolved in H.Res. 504.  \r\n\r\n4) No language is perfect or without loopholes.  The House can waive any rule (even the 2/3 majority requirement) by a simple majority, thought it takes extra steps.

If Bank A wants to give me a mortgage but I have poor credit, they can get Bank B to offer a CDS so that if I default, Bank B pays the remainder of my debt. The CDS is poorly understood, and so the Bank Bs of the world treated it as a source of revenue (Bank A is paying them for the insurance after all) without fully understanding the risk associated (they have to pay up if I default, and they don't know how big of a credit risk I am).  By securing the mortgages, you remove the liability associated with CDSs so companies are at least not forced to pay out on them (thus providing stability).  Most existing CDS assets are horribly over-valued due to speculative, unregulated selling though, and there's nothing that can be done about that.  CDS assets are going to have to be re-valued, because there simply isn't enough money out there to buy them all back.  The CDS market in 2007 was conservatively priced at $45 trillion, no joke.

If the loans are bad then in fact we are buying real estate that we can't sell. How about this solution?\r\n\r\nThe mortgage problem is two-fold:\r\n\r\n1. People bought more than they could afford.\r\n2. Institutions lent them the money when they should not have.\r\n\r\nClearly both the buyer and the lending institution are at fault. So let them both share the fix and the cost. Here's how we do it--set up a government lending institution (call it Bank Assisting Idiot Lenders, or BAIL). If someone can't pay their mortgage they walk into BAIL and say \"here's my mortgage info, we can't make our payment after the balloon comes due.\"\r\n\r\nThe BAIL agent makes a full (and realistic) evaluation of the borrower's ability to pay and gets an accurate (also realistic) evaluation of the worth of the borrower's home. Half of the difference between the current value and the existing mortgage payoff is calculated and called the \"total idiot penalty\", or TIP.\r\n\r\nThis will result in one of two outcomes:\r\n\r\n1. The borrower still can't afford the home and the agent says \"you're out of luck, you need to find a place to rent.\" At that point the original lender has an opportunity to repossess the home and offer it for lease to the former borrower. Otherwise the original lender owns the home. Lender and borrower need to \"grin and bear it.\"\r\n\r\n2. The borrower _can_ afford the home with a new loan. BAIL will pay the original lender their loan payoff minus the TIP and the borrower will refinance the current value of the home plus the TIP. If borrower does not want to pay more for a home than its market value, go to result 1.\r\n\r\nWe taxpayers take the initial hit of paying the TIP to the lender, but get that back plus interest over the term of the loan. This solution gives the qualified buyer a home and the lender a loan payoff. Both share equally in the penalty for making and taking a bad loan. It prevents you and me from taking a massive loan from our children. It allows the market to set home prices. It only spends money where needed.

Who does it protect? The wealthy and powerful whose interests will be hurt if this doesn't pass.

Meanwhile, the wealthy and powerful will become moreso.\r\n\r\nRight now we are borrowing $2 BILLION A DAY to service our national debt. What will another $700 Billion add to this and how does it ever get paid back? And what does it do for the national interests of our country?\r\n\r\nTo accept any form of the bailout as presented by Paulson and Congress is aggegiously, morally wrong.\r\n\r\nHow about this as a bailout plan? Those who have billions, individually and in corporations, trusts, et.al. take it upon themselves to fix the problem they created. Believe me, they have more than enough resources to take care of themselves, the Goldman Sachs, Bank of Americas, JP Morgans, etc. etc. Don't be fooled by their scare tactics of the system collapsing. The only serious thing that will collapse is their wealth.\r\n\r\nWe the people meanwhile, demand that $700 billion be invested in the following: a simplified version granted, but I'd leave the specifics to minds more acutely refined on these matters:\r\n\r\n1) $200 Billion - Alternative energy tax credits that promote energy independence in the next 10 years.\r\n\r\n2) $100 Billion - Education. This will provide real, long lasting benefits for the entire country. \r\n\r\n3) $100 Billion - Health care so that all people can gain access to affordable healthcare.\r\n\r\n4) $100 Billion - Rebuilding Infrastructure in this country, from roads to bridges to utility transmission to transportation.  \r\n\r\n5) $100 Billion to provide relief to those being foreclosed with a cap of $500K of total assets.Allow bankruptcy judges to modify existing mortgage contracts. \r\n\r\n6) $50 Billion to overhaul the IRS and increase serious enforcement of the egregious abuses of tax evasion by wealthy individuals and corporations. David Kay Johnston's book \"Perfectly Legal\" shows how the most powerful and wealthy in this country create the laws with Congress\u2019 backing on both sides of the aisle that allow them to avoid the great majority of the taxes they owe through a myriad of ever changing tax shelters, and then shift the burden on the already overtaxed people in the bottom 90-95% of income and wealth. This will increase tax revenues, according to Johnston, of over $300 Billion annually!\r\n\r\n7) $50 Billion - Redevelop pension plans for employees for real long term security for our work force, not just the corporate owners, directors and stockholders.\r\n\r\nNow I ask: Are the majority of Americans going to benefit from this type of plan, or the one proposed by Paulson and Congress?", "user_url": "", "submit_date": "2008-09-27 17:13:30", "ip_address": "24.205.147.14", "object_pk": "5", "site": 1, "is_removed": false, "user": null, "content_type": 15, "is_public": true, "user_name": "Allan Honrath", "user_email": ""}}, {"pk": 509, "model": "comments.comment", "fields": {"comment": "I say we not buy any bad assets at all, let those bank have losses, and move on, let the soon to be foreclosed loans be reworked with another bank, and let the federal government stay out of the real estate market period.

You must return home after you pass this package to ANGRY constituents with an election less than a month away. Given the massive size of this package, the fact that it rewards the guilty on Wall Street and does nothing to address the cause that anger is fully justified.\r\n    *\r\n      Non-financial private debt is $32.4 trillion dollars1 as of 2Q 2008. Household debt is $14.0 trillion. Households lost 400 billion dollars last quarter. You wish to add $700 billion more in losses (via government obligations that taxpayers must cover) this quarter; this package is insignificant against the total bad credit outstanding. Federal capacity to \u201cbail the system out\u201d is insufficient.\r\n    *\r\n      It will not and cannot work because the issue is trust, not money. There is lots of money (and credit) but it is being hoarded throughout the system. Consumer savings have gone from nothing to the highest rate ever in American history \u2013 in the space of a few months. Money is flying into Treasuries because of lack of trust, not lack of money. You must fix the cause of the problem, not apply band-aids.\r\n    *\r\n      Commercial paper is being cited as the \u201clockup\u201d that threatens an imminent financial train wreck. The truth is that commercial paper rates for \u201cAA\u201d rated non-financial firms is placing at a rate half that of a year ago as the Fed Funds target has been dropped from 5.25 to 2%2. With risk having increased the rate of return offered is lower? This is where the stress is coming from; at last summer\u2019s rates this paper would roll. You are being gamed by Paulson and Bernanke; look at the table in the reference and you will see that even for \u201cthreatened sectors\u201d rates are not materially higher than last year.\r\n    *\r\n      If you pass this bill and the market implodes you will be held directly responsible.

Hopefully, if enough people agree as to the causes, we can converge upon realistic long-term solutions.\r\n\r\n1) Our government has fallen asleep at the wheel, and not just the current administration, but administrations over a period of decades.  They have allowed lenders to take advantage of many American's appetite for credit.  Now that the crisis has escalated to point of no return, our government leaders don't even have the fortitude to tell the American public the truth; that, as a whole, \u201cWe\u201d are a major reason for the current crisis.\r\n\r\n2) The leaders of our major financial institutions have failed to take on the same responsibilities that most American business leaders must abide by.  If you break the law and steal money, you will go to jail.  Instead, our largest financial institutional leaders are rewarded with lavish retirement bonuses and perks.\r\n\r\n3) Finally, many Americans have become financially irresponsible.    We have failed to teach our children the importance of living within our means.  We have failed to teach the basic equation of income vs. borrowing and spending.  If we had properly taught our children to borrow and spend responsibly, we would not be in this crisis.\r\n\r\nIn short, I believe the bail-out plan is a dangerous, short-term, band-aid.  It can only serve to give us a false sense of security.  It won't solve the root causes of our crisis or change the kind of thinking that led to the problems outlined above.

These homeowners are in a world of hurt already because of extenuating circumstances such as loss of job or Medical probles and not neccessarily because they overextended themselves in the first place when the bought their home. These people would, I believe, be selling their current home except for the fact that they CAN NOT sell off the asset because it has declined so much in value as they would loose money and be unable to buy a smaller or less expensive home, in light of this real estate resession, which as we all know was caused by the market bubble created by misdealings of people in Freddie and Fannie and other Companies that deal in Mortgage Backed Securities. So it is the fault of the very people that stand to gain the most by this Bailout (Wall Street) The victims are the homeowners that have lost an emense amount of the value of their current residence and are now going through the embarassment of Bankruptcy JUST TO SAVE THEIR HOMES! They are the ones that are mostly affected by these sharks. These homeowners have an ability to pay most of the secured debt they have signed for or they would not qualify to file for a Chapter 13 to reorganize their debt. Chapter 13 regs allow the BK Judge to mark down other secured debt, like car loans etc.. Why not at least temporarily allow for these adjustments for those hit hardest by the current situation. I believe this will take care of alot of the problems with this meltdown, more of a bottom up approach, than even the bailout provisions to the Bigboys on Wallstreet because my understanding is that $50 billion of mortgages are defaulting MONTHLY right now and that needs to slow down. I believe this could help solve this crisis in a very simple manner, without costing all of us alot of money. After all, these are the assets backing the Mortgage Backed Securities we are bailing out, they are directly linked and in need of an adjustment.

I propose this: Instead of paying the banks and financial institutions first,like a \"Top-Down\" approach, why not start by giving the money to the American people,doing a \"Bottom-Up\" approach? President Bush continues to say that this affects people that have retirement portfolios, college loans,car loans, small and large businesses that use credit to pay their payrolls and invoices,and finally the home owner that purchased a \"Sub-Prime\" mortgage,and has now lost or losing their home. Not one sentence in this bill says that there is going to be any relief in the form of mortgage bailouts.\r\n#1. Put a large chunk of this 700 billion into the Social Security system. That way,if all the financial institutions fail,the people that lose all or most of their nest egg,will still be able to recieve money to pay bills.Many of these retirees have already paid off their mortgages,and use Social Security to pay for necessities,like food,house taxes,electric and water bills,and phone bills. I'm sorry that these same people will not be able to live in style,but when you invest in a portfolio,you sign a paper that tells you that you may lose all your money investing in this. When you sign it,you understand that you may make money,but could lose everything.\r\n#2. Put 100 billion or so into making more government college grants,and allowing easier access to these grants, by making ALL students that apply, not just underprivilaged, low income students, the ability to recieve these grants based on the grades that they make. If you do right in school, and make good grades,like a b-average, and you or your parents don't have,or lost, the money to put you into school, than you should be able to get a grant.\r\n#3. Small business owners know that they pay taxes every month, dealing with sales. and other factors. Why not letting them NOT pay these taxes ,letting them keep this money,so that they may be able to pay staff salaries and invoices on a weekly to monthly basis. This will cost the government 200 or 300 billion in taxes that they would normally recieve, but this makes sure that said businesses don't have to ask these bad banks for credit lines. If you can't pay for your company without credit,than you should not have a business to begin with. These tax breaks will let them keep all their money, and use it to further, or keep afloat there business. If that same business can't keep up, WITH these tax breaks, than they go out of business, just like businesses do day after day.\r\n#4. Make the bill a trillion dollar bill, which it may become anyway, and give 300 billion directly to the American People, giving each person approx. $10,000 dollars. Every single of the 350 million American people,children included, get $10,000 dollars. ALL OF THIS WILL STIMULATE THE ECONOMY, AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR CREDIT OF ANY KIND.

Read the three-page bill at: New York Times http://tinyurl.com/4ts4mq The power it gives the Treasury is unthinkable and tantamount to an attempted financial coup.

They went on to say how they were working on an improved version and that they were working closely with Democrats.

When I was having financial difficulties as a result of poor money management skills and an unreliable income stream(I worked in construction), I did some research and found a credit counselling agency that was not a schill for the banks and went in for advice.

They were looking for debt releif while still driving expensive cars(one was a Lotus), having a maid service clean their house twice a week, eating a restaurants regularly, planning vacations, ect. I feel for peole who really are having a hard time and are doing all they can to get by and there should be releif for them, but far too many people want the government, and by default the taxpayer, to bail them out while they make little or no effort to help themselves.

They can also carry back any current year losses to the two prior years.\r\n\r\nFor example a financial institution with a MBS purchased for $10 million sells it to a govenment agency for $4 million, the resulting $6 million loss will generate a combined federal and state tax benefit of approximately $2.4 million - further burdening the taxpayers. \r\n\r\nThe net effect of the tax impact will be hundreds of billions of dollars of tax refunds to these entities that are beling bailed out - resulting in adding another $100 billion plus to the $800 billion bailout pricetag.\r\n\r\nThe suggested solution, which I circulated to numerous Representatives and Senators, is to simply deny, or at least defer for 3 years (to avoid immediately carrying back the losses), any losses on portfolios sold to a U.S. government agency.

Instead, after waiting so long, I became afraid we would never be able to purchase, as this market was continuing to escalate beyond all reason. I watched one house flip 3 times in 1.5 years, each time increasing by $100,000.  Salaries were not increasing at all, so how could our economy possibly sustain itself at this rate?  No one else seemed concerned though, and I eventually purchased the home I leased, to prevent myself from being locked out of the market.

We were told our mortgage was a fixed rate, but recently learned it was an ARM with untenable adjustment rates. The closing was interrupted, and we had to wait for the papers to be sent by the lender.  I think the switcheroo occurred on those papers then. We have tried to renegotiate our mortgage, but the lender would not do it, preferring to make all the interest it could, and forcing us into foreclosure. Assistance to decrease the interest rate, and add fees into the principal is precisely what we tried to negotiate, without success.  This bill would help put pressure on the lender to renegotiate, and we would continue to make our note.  This is what most people need, not a hand-out, just a sense of fair play, not the greed that created the monster in the first place.

Others disagree. They ask, why not just give cash to the banks to prop them up without buying their toxic mortgage-related securities? \r\n\r\n    Some say, given capital requirements for banks, you get $12 dollars in debt assistance for every $1 of cash you directly pump into a bank. So why not just do that? And take stock in return so the government gets paid back? Basically, they say the government should do what Warren Buffet did when he invested in Goldman Sachs. Give them some cash, take some stock. This is along the lines of what Sweden did to prop up its banks during a banking and real estate crisis in the early 1990's.\r\n\r\n    This is not the approach Paulson has been pushing for. But it's becoming clear that the legislation left room for this approach to be applied in some cases as the Treasury Secretary sees fit.

Yes, you can have your individual accounts covered up to $100,000.00 ($250,000.00) for one person and also your joint accounts the same.  But if you have only CD's  you can have up to the same amount  for each person  (inheritor--POD). The owner remains the same. So I could have up to $300,000.00 ($750,000.00) for a single account and two POD accounts. Plus, I could have an additional joint account for another $100,000.00 ($250,000.00).  Now, if that goes back to $100,000.00 per person  that's only $400,000.00  for retirement money, which is better than nothing, but if a person likes one bank(to spread it around) instead of four it's just not enough coverage, if they have more than $400,000.00.

A brief \u201crun down\u201d will indicate just how costless, indeed how profitable \u2013 to the participants, is the creation of new money. If the Fed puts through buy orders in the open market, the Federal Reserve Banks acquire earning assets, by initially creating new inter-bank demand deposits (IBDDs). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Treasury recaptures c. 97% of the net income from these assets (via SOMA). The commercial banks (collectively, or as a SYSTEM) acquire \u201cfree/gratis\u201d legal reserves, yet the bankers complain (always have their hand in the cookie jar) that they are not earning any interest on their balances in the Federal Reserve Banks (IBDDs), i.e., that it is a regulatory burden [sic]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, if as the bankers & their collaborators say (this is a tax), then why is it, that when excess reserves are added by the FED, that the member commercial banks collectively expand loans & invest? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the basis of these newly acquired reserves, the commercial banks can, and do, create a multiple volume of credit and money. And through this money, they acquire a concomitant volume of additional earnings assets. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much is this multiple expansion of money, credit, and bank earning assets? Thanks to fractional reserve banking (an essential characteristic of commercial banking) for every billion dollars of legal reserves pumped into the member banks by the Fed, the banking system can, and does, acquire c. 208+ billion dollars in earning assets through credit creation (based on the money multiplier or expansion coefficient). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe return of $208 billion dwarfs the interest foregone on idle reserves [sic]. I.e., the banks rate of return (payment of interest on bank balances) on required reserves = 1.4% & for excess reserves = .75%.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe banks rate of return on more than $207 billion is obviously 207% higher.  The conclusion is obvious. Legal reserves are not a tax, they are like manna from Heaven.   I.e, the banks get paid twice. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd unfortunately for the rest of us, this money creation does not provide the remotest assurance or possibility that the dollars created will be matched in the marketplace by an offsetting addition to the volume of goods and services offered. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 3 taxes:  (1) direct tax is the one on the citizens of the United States, and (2) the TAX, is INFLATION, (3) (and the last one, on the capacity of these collaborator's minds). \r\n\r\nLegal reserves are a credit control device.

That was what the Treas. \u2013 Fed. Res.

Plus there were controls on prices and wages that kept the reported rate of inflation down.\r\n\r\nThere are only 3 interest rates that the Fed can directly control in the short-run; the discount rate charged to bank borrowers & the primary credit rate for both the PDCF & ABCP.

Rescuing financial institutions goes well beyond Wall Street to our local bank and yes to our employers.  \r\n\r\nIndividuals and businesses (employers, pensions, municipalities etc) deposit money in the bank.  The reserve requirement was 10% for several decades, meaning the banks could lend 9 times the deposits for business loans, mortgages, etc.  The interest is how they make money (ESPECIALLY on mortgages).  The $1000 becomes $10,000 ($9000 lent out, plus the 10% on deposit).  \r\n\r\nBanks also lend each other money overnight to meet their nightly reserve requirements.  Gigantic companies like GE and GM also lend and borrow overnight, short term (30-120 days), etc.  Usually this is for day-to-day expenses and it may include payroll.  Mutual fund companies are enormous participants in overnight, 7-day and short term lending.  It funds their money market accounts.  This is the primary reason when Lehman Brothers (and their money mkt accounts) was allowed to fail, it became a run on the other institutions.  Hedge funds, state and corporate pensions, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, insurance companies, and personal investors are heavily invested in money markets.  Please understand that it is a SACRED RULE on Wall Street for a money market fund to NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES fall below $1, even if the firm takes a beating on the underlying investments.  For one fund to fail is an across-the-board emergency.\r\n\r\nIt did not help matters in the slightest that the reserve requirement was loosened, just when interest rates reached record lows.  Everyone could borrow money for next to nothing.  And the securities firms plowed into CDSs.  I don't know much about them, but the basic premise is an investor may have reason to believe (or fear) that the bonds issued by a company may fail.  A contract is drawn, a premium paid, and if in fact that company can't make good on paying off those bonds, the investor makes money.\r\n\r\nHowever, being unregulated, no one knew how much risk was really out there, or if the CDS issuers could pay off massive waves of claims.  \r\n\r\nIt's surprising that collaterized debt securities were completely unregulated.  Clever, yes, but without oversight even our country's best ideas can run away from us and blow up everywhere.\r\n\r\nIf you felt pinched by the credit freeze, suddenly the underpinnings of all these firms around the world become directly related to you personally, and you can't believe it!  \r\n\r\nSo think about it.  We live in a capitalist nation.  There is nowhere you can go to buy anything - a Twinkie or a mansion or a business - without US currency.

Treasury Secretary Paulson\u2019s Troubled Asset Relief Program was not the kind of credit repair scores the endangered homeowners needed. However, a new mortgage program is underway. Thanks to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair, 1.5 million homeowners will have a sturdy backbone when they\u2019re facing foreclosure. This $24.4 billion program will be drawn from the $700 billion pool that TARP set up. With this straightforward system, lenders will be given a fixed amount of $1,000 per loan they renegotiate with financially stuck homeowners. In addition, the FDIC has promised to take on up to 50 percent of the loss in the event of a default on a loan. While others view the action on Bair\u2019s part as a needed investment to maintain liquidity in the mortgage industry, Paulson has predestined this as mere spending that will only bankrupt the FDIC.

If you\u2019re a seasoned baseball fan, or any pro sport for that matter, you\u2019ve probably heard the expression \u201cholding a city for ransom.\u201d In general terms, this means that team ownership is always on the lookout for increased profits, even if they\u2019re shelling out as much in payroll as teams like the Los Angeles Dodgers, Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees. They will threaten to pull their team out of the city and move elsewhere unless the city and its taxpaying base meet the team\u2019s demands. Nearly without fail, this demand is the greatest way to create \u201cbuzz\u201d that brings the fans out in droves: building a new stadium. This may seem like an expensive endeavor, but not necessarily for ownership. New stadiums are, in fact, financed by taxpayers like you and me. In a very interesting USA Today story, you can get a sense of how astronomical the numbers can be. According to Gary Thorne, \u201cThe Yankees have already received $942 million in tax-exempt bonds for the construction of the new Yankee Stadium. They are seeking another $366 million in such bonds.\u201d It\u2019s all paid for by Joe Taxpayer. Congressional Subcommittee Chair Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) nails it by saying this ransoming is a \u201ctransfer of wealth from the many taxpayers to a few wealthy owners.\u201d If you value pro sports as much as I do, you may see this as a necessary evil, but Congress wants to change that system. When it comes to financing, it doesn\u2019t seem fair. Honestly, if you take out payday installment loans, do you expect someone else to pay them back for you? No, and neither should baseball owners.

Why?  Simple!  The people demanded it.

No Tenure / No Pension. \r\n  \r\nA Congressman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they are out of office.  \r\n  \r\n3.  Congress (past, present & future) participates in Social Security. \r\n  \r\nAll funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to the Social Security system immediately.  All future funds flow into the Social Security system, and Congress participates with the American people. \r\n  \r\n4. Congress can purchase their own retirement plan, just as all Americans do. \r\n  \r\n5. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise.  Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%. \r\n  \r\n6. Congress loses their current health care system and participates in the same health care system as the American people. \r\n  \r\n7. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the American people. \r\n  \r\n8. All contracts with past and present Congressmen are void effective 1/1/11.  \r\n  \r\nThe American people did not make this contract with Congressmen.  Congressmen made all these contracts for themselves. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nServing in Congress is an honor, not a career.

While well intended, unfortunately this proposal will not fix problems with the LDA but rather make them far worse in terms of both transparency and the public interest.

The LDA also is vastly underinclusive in that it covers only registered, direct lobbyists and not most business executives, lawyers and public relations consultants who are not registered lobbyists. Finally, the Obama Administration has turned the LDA into a punitive statute that restricts public service and participation by top public-interest leaders without confronting the real problem of money in politics.  See www.clpi.org and the January 21, 2010 letter signed by 13 public-interest organizations opposing the Administration's well-intended but misguided restrictions, including the Alliance for Children and Families, Common Cause, Consumers Union, Human Rights Watch, and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.  So long as the LDA is no longer employed as a pure disclosure law, public-interest organizations will strongly oppose any attempts that will further chill much-needed policy engagement by the people through nonprofits while allowing private interests to continue business as usual.
